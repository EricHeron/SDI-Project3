<p>This week I have chosen to change my story once again. I will be writing about my pets this time. This project will build on what I have been learning since the beginning of this course. There are many aspects that will need to be covered so, I hope I capture all of those items and tell a good story at the same time. Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy.</p>
